    "your own modules to retrieve services to scale, metrics to make scaling decisions and instigate a scaling action. The Autoscaler service provides\n" +
    "a source for Marathon that identifies services to scale using Marathon labels. A RabbitMQ workload analyzer retrieves details of RabbitMQ\n" +
