The Analytics service provides a REST API to query and retrieve information from structured and un-structured data sources. You can perform
full-text and field-based queries to retrieve data stored as documents in an unstructured database. The API provides a simple query language,
which is loosely based on the contextual query language specification. In addition to simple queries, the API provides a way to write SQL
templates, which allow you to perform analytical operations such as aggregations, averages, time series analysis, log analysis, trend detection
and so on. You can also apply full-text query filters on analytical queries.
