# Accelerate your time to value

The Common Application Framework is a collection of microservices essential for any developer of big data applications. 
We are the recognized leaders in delivering big data enterprise applications and we designed these services to form the core of our next generation archiving, 
back-up, content management, and analytics products.

We're committed to open-sourcing all of these services to more rapidly fuel innovation in the community as well as to provide standards 
with regards to the management of unstructured information at scale.

Each microservice is wrapped in a Docker container for light-weight portability and rapid development. 
They can be deployed stand-alone or with fault-tolerant queues running on Apache Mesos with Marathon for massive scalability 
and high availability. These services are designed for SaaS deployment and are fully multi-tenant aware.
