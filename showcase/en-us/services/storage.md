The Storage Service allows for the secure upload and download of assets to locations offered by storage providers.
This service makes it easy to define the configurations and security credentials of storage providers and how they handle assets. It also offers a REST API which enables simple, smooth and effortless storage operations.
Multiple storage providers are integrated into the Storage Service, including File System based and Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3).
