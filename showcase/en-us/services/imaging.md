
The Imaging service provides the ability to convert between HTML and searchable PDF, as well as between PDF and JPEG, PNG, TIFF and other common image formats. In addition to format conversion, the Imaging service supports document mark-up with redactions and endorsements. Redactions can permanently remove sensitive content from documents while endorsements can add text annotations to documents.
